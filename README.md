# Welcome Guys ðŸ‘‹

## Assignment Goals & notes
- **Learning:**
  - Not every interview is successful
  - So for me, it's all about learning new tech
  - This way I win whatever happens
  - So thank you for your patience
- **The stack:**
  - NX
  - NestJS *new for me*
  - React
  - NextJS w/app router *new for me*
  - tailwindcss *new for me*
- **Requirements:**
  - people & planets: links above
  - Name filter above the tables: Done
  - BONUS: caching mechanism: Done, I used Next's cache, it was easy to implement out of the box, search for 'force-cache'
  - BONUS: caching mechanism: I also added cache to nest, nest also had a 'plugNplay' cache solution
  - BONUS: autocomplete: Nope, you can't have it all :)
  - BONUS: Typescript can be a big bonus: Done
